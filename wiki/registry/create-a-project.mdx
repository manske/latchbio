**Discover optimal antibody candidates through multiple rounds of phage display assays.**

To identify the most suitable antibody candidates, scientists may employ several rounds of phage display assays. To facilitate this, we can create a table consisting of SRA IDs and their corresponding FastQ files in Latch Registry. Each biological sample is accompanied by information regarding the selection method employed for the phage display assay, as well as the experimental conditions. Following data acquisition, this table can be incorporated into a Latch workflow to derive enrichment scores for diverse antibody sequences

Explore **top differentially expressed genes using public transcriptomics studies**. In this project, we imported several transcriptomics studies using bulk RNA-sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways across a range of biological conditions.
