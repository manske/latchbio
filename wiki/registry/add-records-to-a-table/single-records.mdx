A record with the name “Record 0” will be created. You can change the record names to anything you like, as long as record names are unique within the table.

To add additional attributes, or columns, to the record, click on the plus button, as shown in the picture below.

You will see a dropdown menu of different types that you can assign to the column. For every column, you can specify the column name, and whether the column is required and contains multiple or single entries.

For example, here we are creating a column called “Sequencing Read”. The cells within the column are required to be files on Latch and end with the file extension fastq.gz. The cell can also contain multiple files.
