title: "Modify Records in a Table"
---

There are multiple ways you can modify record(s) in a registry table:

1. Edit a single cell value at once
2. Edit multiple cell values at once

## Edit a single cell value at a time

Similar to a spreadsheet interface, you can double click on each cell and assign it to a new value.

Alternatively, you can check the box next to the record you want to modify. The sidebar will display attributes associated with that record and provide an easy way where you can edit.

## Edit multiple cell values at once

If you want to assign the same value to multiple cells at once, you can bulk select multiple records, and change the attribute value using the sidebar.
