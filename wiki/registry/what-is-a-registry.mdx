## What is Registry?
Latch Registry is a flexible sample management system for the wet and dry lab. Through a familiar spreadsheet interface, scientists can link sequencing files to contextual metadata collected in a lab. Computational biologists can easily bring samples and metadata into bioinformatics workflows on Latch.

Latch Registry is the source of truth that enables reliable, reproducible, and shareable computational analysis that is accessible to everyone on the team – from biologists, to bioinformaticians, to executives.

## Who is Latch Registry for?

Latch Registry is built for cross-functional wet and dry lab teams.

**For wet lab scientists, Registry offers:**
    - An intuitive spreadsheet interface to input experimental metadata and autolink them with sequencing files
    - Effortless import of data in bulk via CSV file uploads
    - A streamlined process for searching and filtering bioinformatics results and sequencing files next to experimental metadata from the lab

**For bioinformaticians and computational biologists alike, Registry offers:**
    - Programmatic access to manipulate data in Registry
    - Batch execution of Registry samples through bioinformatics workflows
    - Automatic population of workflow outputs into Registry

**For team leads and executives, Registry offers:**
    - A single place to track all your files, metadata, and analyses, so that you never incorrectly enter information or lose files again.
    - Quickly search and filter top candidates for a drug discovery campaign, and audit past decisions with ease.

## Use Cases
- **Organize** terabytes of files and their metadata in one place.
- **Visualize** your data by previewing large files without downloading them (FastQs, BAM, SAM, VCF, etc.)
- **Collaborate** on results of compute-heavy pipelines, such as Bulk RNA-seq or AlphaFold2, between the wet and dry lab teams.
- **Link** between different experiments and drug discovery campaigns to facilitate longitudinal analyses and accelerate discovery.
- **Decide** faster by viewing and searching through the historical data, visualizations, and analyzes that all teams have access to.
