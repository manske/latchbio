## Latch Data

Here you can upload, store, and visualize your data. Data stored here can be analyzed by workflows on Latch and you can view the outputted results right here in Latch. To upload data you can either drag and drop it or click the upload button to select the data you want from your computer. Latch also allows you integrate with [BaseSpace](/wiki/basespace) and mount an [S3 Bucket](/wiki/s3-bucket).

## Latch Workflows

Here is where all of your analysis will take place. Workflows contain two subsections: **My Workflows** and **All Workflows**. If this is the first time you are using Latch, you will likely have zero workflow in **My Workflows**. You can find your first workflow in the **All Workflows** tab. Here, you can choose to test run a few workflows by selecting **Run Workflow**. You can also choose to add workflows to **My Workflow** for quick reference to them in the future.

Please note that **Verified** workflows are built by Latch engineers, and hence will have higher quality and reliability. Other workflows are built by various community members, so make sure you try and test them yourself.

To test out a workflow this way click the **Use Test Data** button. This will fill out all of the necessary parameters with sample data, and then launch the workflow. If a workflow doesn‚Äôt have test data, you can easily download test data of your choice and upload them to Latch Data for use in the workflow.

## What should I do if I get stuck or encounter a problem when getting started?

You've got several options here. If you've exhausted the docs or find them completely unhelpful (which if that's the case please do let us know), you are more than welcome to contact us with any problems, questions, feedback, bugs you might encounter. There is a contact us icon in the bottom left hand corner of the platform you can use to get in contact with us.
