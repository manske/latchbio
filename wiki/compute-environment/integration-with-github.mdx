**Loading your GitHub repository when starting a Pod**

If you want to have a GitHub repository automatically added to your Pod, as you are starting a new Pod, you can:

- Navigate to your GitHub repository.
- Copy the URL to the GitHub repository. For example, here we are copying https://github.com/latch-verified/bulk-rnaseq.
