## How to run DECODR Count on Latch

1. **Add DECODR to your Workspace**
   1. Find DECODER in "All Workflows" and open the workflow
2. **Enter parameters for DECODR**
3. **Launch the workflow**
4. **Results appear in Latch Data instantly**

## Parameters

### Sample Names

- The names or labels of your samples

### Sample Types

- These types are clonal or bulk. The sample type sets a limit on the number of sequences DECODR can find in an experimental trace.

### Guide Sequences

- Enter each gRNA (max 2), 17-30 nucleotides. Don't include the PAM (NGG) in the sequence)
- Example Value: AGTGCTGATCGTACTCAGAGGAC

### Donor sequence (optional)

- A sequence of 36 to 300 nucleotides with homology arms at least 18bp long
- Example Value: AGTGCTGATCGTCAGCATGACGTATGACTACTACGTAGTGCTTGCTAGCTGATCG

### Wild Type/Control File

- This can be input of one of two ways

1. File input: Browse to select your wild type/control file.
   1. Accepted File Types: .ab1, .fasta, .fastq., .txt
2. Text input: Enter the plain text sequence. This value must be at least 300 nucleotides

### Experiment Files

- You can upload multiple files here to do a bulk analysis
- Accepted File Types: .ab1, .fasta, .fastq., .txt
