## Locate your Client ID and Client Secret

When a UKG Dimensions tenant is created, a password-protected Excel worksheet is attached to your company's Salesforce account that contains
the Client ID and Client Secret.
If you do not have access to these details, contact your system administrator. If for some reason these details have been lost, open a support case.
