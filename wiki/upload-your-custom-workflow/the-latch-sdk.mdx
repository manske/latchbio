sidebarTitle: "The Latch SDK"
description: "The Latch SDK is an open-source toolchain to define serverless bioinformatics workflows with plain python and deploy associated no-code interfaces using single command."
---

It takes months to build infrastructure with the compute, storage, and user-friendly interface necessary to run bioinformatics pipelines at scale.

Bioinformatics workflows developed with the SDK automatically receive:

- Instant no-code interfaces for accessibility and publication
- First class static typing
- Containerization and versioning of every registered change
- Reliable and scalable managed cloud infrastructure
- Single line definition of arbitrary resource requirements (eg. CPU, GPU) for serverless execution
